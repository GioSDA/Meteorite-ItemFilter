# GioSDA's Item Filter Plugin

This plugin was initially made for a server called MeteoritePVP, however that server is now defunct so I am releasing the plugin's source code for anyone to use.

## Features:
- Allows users to filter what items they would like to pick up via /filter
- Items are customizable via GUI and supports custom items
- GUI is fully customizable through the config
- Filter is toggleable
- All text in the plugin is customizable through the config

This plugin is not being maintained.
